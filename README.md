## Final Thoughts 🧠:

- I wanted to build an app that I have interest in and I walso wanted to learn django for backend. I learned that I like nodeJS better, but Ill pull through. <br/>

- Code structure and organization wise, I wasn't worried so much because it's not such a big application and I would only be working on it, I didn't want to make it more complcited with props and extra over organization for a simple application.
